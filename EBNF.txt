Four main sections:
1. Gate_information: In this section, we define the basic information for gates used in the circuit, e.g. the type of the gates and how many inputs the gates have 
2. Initial_devices: In this section, we inistialise the devices 
3. Connections: In this section, we provide connection details
4. Monitor_points: In this section, we show the monitor points for the circuit. If this section does not appear, the output will be shown later.
